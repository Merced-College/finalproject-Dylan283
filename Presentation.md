My final project is a simple text-based adventure game where the player explores a small dungeon, collects items, and fights enemies. The player earns and spends gold in a basic shop system and uses inventory items to get stronger in battles. The game is entertaining because it includes random events and choices, so each play-through can feel slightly different. Even though the game is played in the terminal, it still gives the player a sense of progress as they uncover more of the map and survive longer against enemies. It is also useful because it demonstrates how different data structures and algorithms can be used together to build a working program.
In my project, one of my algorithms controls the event system inside EventQueue.java. It stores events in order and processes them with FIFO logic, so the game reacts to things in the correct sequence. Another algorithm I wrote is in Player.java, where I manage the player’s gold and items by using a HashMap. This allows the player to earn or lose gold during the game, and the program keeps track of inventory automatically. I also wrote an algorithm in Main.java that runs the basic game flow by adding events and printing them out, which makes the gameplay progress step by step. All of these algorithms are simple but important because they control different parts of how the game runs internally.
In my project, I mainly used a Queue in EventQueue.java, which is built using Java’s LinkedList class. I coded it by creating an object that stores events and handles them in first-in, first-out order. This helps control the flow of the game by processing one event at a time. My project also uses a LinkedList indirectly because when I created the queue, Java automatically uses a LinkedList internally to store the elements. Finally, I used simple variables and data fields inside Player.java to track things like the player’s name and gold so the game can keep track of progress while it runs. Each of these structures helps organize my code and keeps the program easy to follow.
In the next version of my game, I would like to add more gameplay features such as a real battle system and different enemy types. I would also expand the player system by adding an inventory and items that affect the player’s stats. Another improvement I want to make is adding a basic shop so the player can buy upgrades using gold they earn. Later on, I would like to build a larger map and maybe add simple graphics so the game feels more interactive. These changes would make the game more advanced and more fun to play.
